# Backend Task

## Introduction

This is a simple task to create a suitable API back-end incorporating:

 * several routes and HTTP methods
 * validation of input URI segments, parameters and data
 * generating suitable responses and/or error messages
 * testing

The solution **must** be in a back-end lanaguage capable of running on a HTTP server. You can use whatever framework or dependencies you require - e.g. PHP/Symfony, Ruby/Rails, Python/Django, JavaScript/Next. You could even use no external dependencies - it's up to you.

## Minimum Requirements

## Models



## Optional Requirements

## Submission

Here's what you'll need to send us:

 * A link to a **public** GitHub repo that you have created, containing the code
 * It should contain a suite of unit tests (using whichever test framework you prefer)
 * It should also contain a README.md file explaining how to run the app and its tests

**The task should take no longer than 2.5 hours.**
